# Angular Development Rules

- Use Angular 20 with TypeScript strict mode enabled.
- Follow Angular style guide: 
  - Use feature-based folder structure (`/features`, `/shared`, `/core`).
  - Use standalone components (`standalone: true`) instead of NgModules.
  - Use OnPush change detection strategy in all components.
  - Prefix all components with `app-`.
- State management must use Angular **Signals**, not NgRx or BehaviorSubject.
- Keep components dumb/presentational where possible, push business logic into services.
- Always type inputs/outputs, avoid `any`.
- Use RxJS only for HTTP calls or when combining async streams, not for global state.
- Follow clean architecture:
  - `/core`: services, interceptors, models.
  - `/features`: feature components.
  - `/shared`: UI components, directives, pipes.
