# UI & UX Rules

- Use Angular + TailwindCSS for styling.
- Use responsive layouts (flex, grid) with mobile-first design.
- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Weather dashboard must include:
  - Current weather component.
  - 5-day forecast component.
  - Settings panel (unit toggle: °C / °F).
  - Favorite cities list.
- Follow accessibility best practices (alt text, aria labels, proper color contrast).
- Prefer reusable UI components (e.g., button, card, input).
